# BigEarthNet-MM

This folder contains the images to run the evaluation, and the code used to perform the data fusion (originally, the SAR images were stored in a folder called BigEarthNet-S1 and the optical images, in BigEarthNet-S2).

When extracting the data, this folder should contain the folder (not the archive) `test` as well as the file `test_10k.csv`.

Code and splits inspired from the official BigEarthNet [GitLab Repo](https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/BigEarthNet-MM_tools).
